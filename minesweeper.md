That's wonderful to hear! I'm glad the explanations are helpful. And thank you for the feedback, it's very much appreciated.

Building online gambling games with Three.js and Angular is an interesting and challenging project. A minesweeper-style game is a great starting point.

Here are a few things to consider as you move forward with your minesweeper project:

1. Game Logic:

Mine Placement: Develop a robust algorithm for randomly placing mines on the grid, ensuring a fair distribution.
Tile States: Implement logic to manage tile states (hidden, revealed, flagged, mined).
Win/Loss Conditions: Define clear win/loss conditions and implement the logic to check them.
Reveal Logic: Implement the logic for revealing adjacent tiles when a safe tile is clicked.
2. Three.js Implementation:

Grid Representation: Decide how to represent the game grid in Three.js (e.g., using a grid of meshes, similar to the crate example).
Tile Visuals: Create visual representations for different tile states (hidden, revealed, flagged, mined).
Click Handling: Implement click handling to detect tile clicks and trigger game logic.
Animations: Add animations for revealing tiles, explosions, and win/loss states.
3. Angular Integration:

Component Structure: Design a clear component structure to separate game logic and Three.js rendering.
Data Binding: Use Angular's data binding to update the Three.js scene based on game state changes.
Game State Management: Consider using a state management library (e.g., NgRx, Akita) to manage the game's state.
User Interface: Create a user interface for displaying game information (e.g., mine count, timer) and providing controls (e.g., flag button).
4. Online Gambling Considerations:

Random Number Generation (RNG): Ensure you use a secure and certified RNG for mine placement.
Fairness and Transparency: Provide clear documentation and mechanisms to ensure fairness and transparency.
Regulatory Compliance: Be aware of and comply with all relevant regulations for online gambling in your target markets.
Security: Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent cheating.
Tips for Minesweeper:

Tile Numbering: When a tile is revealed, display the number of adjacent mines.
Flagging: Allow players to flag tiles they suspect contain mines.
Recursive Reveal: Implement a recursive reveal algorithm to automatically reveal adjacent safe tiles.
